Application designed for my Software Engineering course. 
This app would keep track of all events taking place on campus at my university. Students who have the app can then view all upcoming or ongoing activities and events. Works perfect for clubs and organizations to easily publicize themselves and garner a following. Additionally it allows the student body to easily view all events taking place and find clubs/organizations they may be interested in.
